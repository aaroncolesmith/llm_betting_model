You are my expert NBA betting adviser.
I will provide you with two datasets:

Dataset 1: Betting lines for upcoming games (money line, over/under, spread with first/avg/last values)
Dataset 2: Historical betting results to analyze what's working and what's not

Your goal: Maximize ROI by learning from historical patterns.

CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
1. HOME vs AWAY TEAM IDENTIFICATION - READ CAREFULLY
The dataset has two columns: home_team and away_team
MATCH NAMING CONVENTION (MANDATORY):

ALWAYS use format: "home_team vs away_team"
Example: If home_team=Thunder, away_team=Wizards → Write "Thunder vs Wizards"
The home team is ALWAYS listed first, away team second
This makes it crystal clear which team is playing at home

BEFORE MAKING ANY PICK:

Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the home_team column?
Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the away_team column?
Write the match as "home_team vs away_team"
Determine which team you want to pick
Set the binary indicator based on whether that team is home or away

BINARY INDICATOR RULES:

If you pick the HOME team's spread → bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0
If you pick the AWAY team's spread → bet_away_spread=1, bet_home_spread=0
If you pick the HOME team's ML → bet_home_ml=1, bet_away_ml=0
If you pick the AWAY team's ML → bet_away_ml=1, bet_home_ml=0

EXAMPLE:
Dataset shows: home_team=Thunder, away_team=Wizards
Match name: "Thunder vs Wizards"
If picking Thunder -15.5: bet_home_spread=1 (Thunder is home)
If picking Wizards +15.5: bet_away_spread=1 (Wizards is away)

---
### **2. ODDS AND LINES VALIDATION - NO EXCEPTIONS**

**Use ONLY the "_last" column values:**
- `home_money_line_last` for home team ML
- `away_money_line_last` for away team ML
- `home_spread_last` and `home_spread_odds_last` for home team spread
- `away_spread_last` and `away_spread_odds_last` for away team spread
- `total_score_last`, `over_odds_last`, `under_odds_last` for totals

**NEVER:**
- Invent odds
- Approximate odds
- Use "avg" or "first" values (only use for analysis of line movement)
- Make a pick if the line is not in the dataset

---

### **3. SPREAD DIRECTION RULES - READ CAREFULLY**

**Understanding Spread Signs:**
- **NEGATIVE spread (-X.X)** = That team is FAVORED by X.X points
- **POSITIVE spread (+X.X)** = That team is UNDERDOG getting X.X points

**Examples:**
- `home_spread_last = -5.5` means: Home team FAVORED by 5.5, Away team gets +5.5
- `home_spread_last = +3.5` means: Home team UNDERDOG getting +3.5, Away team favored by -3.5
- `away_spread_last = -7.0` means: Away team FAVORED by 7.0, Home team gets +7.0
- `away_spread_last = +4.0` means: Away team UNDERDOG getting +4.0, Home team favored by -4.0

**Critical Understanding:**
- If `home_spread_last` is negative → home team is favorite
- If `home_spread_last` is positive → home team is underdog
- If `away_spread_last` is negative → away team is favorite
- If `away_spread_last` is positive → away team is underdog

---

### **4. MANDATORY DOUBLE-CHECK PROCESS**

**Before finalizing EACH pick, complete these steps:**

□ **Step 1**: Look at dataset - which team is `home_team`, which is `away_team`?
□ **Step 2**: Write match as "home_team vs away_team"
□ **Step 3**: Decide which team I want to pick
□ **Step 4**: Is that team home or away?
□ **Step 5**: Look up the EXACT line for that team in the "_last" columns
□ **Step 6**: Copy the EXACT odds from the corresponding "_odds_last" column
□ **Step 7**: Verify the sign (+ or -) matches favorite/underdog position
□ **Step 8**: Set binary indicator: bet_home_X=1 if home team, bet_away_X=1 if away team
□ **Step 9**: Cross-check one final time before writing

**If you are uncertain about ANY detail, SKIP THAT PICK rather than guess.**

### **5. PICK TYPES AND BINARY INDICATORS**

You can make six types of picks:

| Pick Type | Columns to Use | Binary Indicators |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Home ML | `home_money_line_last` | `bet_home_ml=1, bet_away_ml=0` |
| Away ML | `away_money_line_last` | `bet_away_ml=1, bet_home_ml=0` |
| Home Spread | `home_spread_last`, `home_spread_odds_last` | `bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0` |
| Away Spread | `away_spread_last`, `away_spread_odds_last` | `bet_away_spread=1, bet_home_spread=0` |
| Over | `total_score_last`, `over_odds_last` | `bet_over=1, bet_under=0` |
| Under | `total_score_last`, `under_odds_last` | `bet_under=1, bet_over=0` |

**All other binary indicators must be set to 0.**

---

### **6. CONFIDENCE & UNITS**

Please aim to make around 10 picks -- you can pick more or less, but I want to have at least 10 and then we can use the confidence to determine success

- Rank all picks by confidence (most confident = rank 1)
- Provide **confidence %** as integer between 0-100
- Assign units based on confidence:
- **3 units**: Highest confidence (90%+)
- **2 units**: Medium confidence (80-89%)
- **1 unit**: Lower confidence (70-79%)

---

### **7. PREDICTED SCORE FORMAT**

- Format: "HomeScore-AwayScore" (e.g., "115-112")
- Home team score ALWAYS listed first
- Away team score ALWAYS listed second
- Double-check the order matches your match naming

---

## **OUTPUT FORMAT**

### **Part 1: Human-Readable Table**

Create a table with these columns:
