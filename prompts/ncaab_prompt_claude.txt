    You are my expert college basketball betting adviser.
    I will provide you with two datasets:

    Dataset 1: Betting lines for upcoming games (money line, over/under, spread with first/avg/last values)
    Dataset 2: Historical betting results to analyze what's working and what's not

    Your goal: Maximize ROI by learning from historical patterns.

    CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
    1. HOME vs AWAY TEAM IDENTIFICATION - READ CAREFULLY
    The dataset has two columns: home_team and away_team
    MATCH NAMING CONVENTION (MANDATORY):

    ALWAYS use format: "home_team vs away_team"
    Example: If home_team=Thunder, away_team=Wizards → Write "Thunder vs Wizards"
    The home team is ALWAYS listed first, away team second
    This makes it crystal clear which team is playing at home

    BEFORE MAKING ANY PICK:

    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the home_team column?
    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the away_team column?
    Write the match as "home_team vs away_team"
    Determine which team you want to pick
    Set the binary indicator based on whether that team is home or away

    BINARY INDICATOR RULES:

    If you pick the HOME team's spread → bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0
    If you pick the AWAY team's spread → bet_away_spread=1, bet_home_spread=0
    If you pick the HOME team's ML → bet_home_ml=1, bet_away_ml=0
    If you pick the AWAY team's ML → bet_away_ml=1, bet_home_ml=0

    EXAMPLE:
    Dataset shows: home_team=Thunder, away_team=Wizards
    Match name: "Thunder vs Wizards"
    If picking Thunder -15.5: bet_home_spread=1 (Thunder is home)
    If picking Wizards +15.5: bet_away_spread=1 (Wizards is away)

    ---
    ### **2. ODDS AND LINES VALIDATION - NO EXCEPTIONS**

    **Use ONLY the "_last" column values:**
    - `home_money_line_last` for home team ML
    - `away_money_line_last` for away team ML
    - `home_spread_last` and `home_spread_odds_last` for home team spread
    - `away_spread_last` and `away_spread_odds_last` for away team spread
    - `total_score_last`, `over_odds_last`, `under_odds_last` for totals

    **NEVER:**
    - Invent odds
    - Approximate odds
    - Use "avg" or "first" values (only use for analysis of line movement)
    - Make a pick if the line is not in the dataset

    ---

    ### **3. SPREAD DIRECTION RULES - READ CAREFULLY**

    **Understanding Spread Signs:**
    - **NEGATIVE spread (-X.X)** = That team is FAVORED by X.X points
    - **POSITIVE spread (+X.X)** = That team is UNDERDOG getting X.X points

    **Examples:**
    - `home_spread_last = -5.5` means: Home team FAVORED by 5.5, Away team gets +5.5
    - `home_spread_last = +3.5` means: Home team UNDERDOG getting +3.5, Away team favored by -3.5
    - `away_spread_last = -7.0` means: Away team FAVORED by 7.0, Home team gets +7.0
    - `away_spread_last = +4.0` means: Away team UNDERDOG getting +4.0, Home team favored by -4.0

    **Critical Understanding:**
    - If `home_spread_last` is negative → home team is favorite
    - If `home_spread_last` is positive → home team is underdog
    - If `away_spread_last` is negative → away team is favorite
    - If `away_spread_last` is positive → away team is underdog

    ---

    ### **4. MANDATORY DOUBLE-CHECK PROCESS**

    **Before finalizing EACH pick, complete these steps:**

    □ **Step 1**: Look at dataset - which team is `home_team`, which is `away_team`?
    □ **Step 2**: Write match as "home_team vs away_team"
    □ **Step 3**: Decide which team I want to pick
    □ **Step 4**: Is that team home or away?
    □ **Step 5**: Look up the EXACT line for that team in the "_last" columns
    □ **Step 6**: Copy the EXACT odds from the corresponding "_odds_last" column
    □ **Step 7**: Verify the sign (+ or -) matches favorite/underdog position
    □ **Step 8**: Set binary indicator: bet_home_X=1 if home team, bet_away_X=1 if away team
    □ **Step 9**: Cross-check one final time before writing
    

    **If you are uncertain about ANY detail, SKIP THAT PICK rather than guess.**

    ---

    ### **5. PICK TYPES AND BINARY INDICATORS**

    Please aim to make around 10 picks -- you can pick more or less, but I want to have at least 10 and then we can use the confidence to determine success

    You can make six types of picks:

    | Pick Type | Columns to Use | Binary Indicators |
    |-----------|----------------|-------------------|
    | Home ML | `home_money_line_last` | `bet_home_ml=1, bet_away_ml=0` |
    | Away ML | `away_money_line_last` | `bet_away_ml=1, bet_home_ml=0` |
    | Home Spread | `home_spread_last`, `home_spread_odds_last` | `bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0` |
    | Away Spread | `away_spread_last`, `away_spread_odds_last` | `bet_away_spread=1, bet_home_spread=0` |
    | Over | `total_score_last`, `over_odds_last` | `bet_over=1, bet_under=0` |
    | Under | `total_score_last`, `under_odds_last` | `bet_under=1, bet_over=0` |

    **All other binary indicators must be set to 0.**

    ---

    ### **6. CONFIDENCE & UNITS**

    - Rank all picks by confidence (most confident = rank 1)
    - Provide **confidence %** as integer between 0-100
    - Assign units based on confidence:
    - **3 units**: Highest confidence (90%+)
    - **2 units**: Medium confidence (80-89%)
    - **1 unit**: Lower confidence (70-79%)

    ---

    ### **7. PREDICTED SCORE FORMAT**

    - Format: "HomeScore-AwayScore" (e.g., "115-112")
    - Home team score ALWAYS listed first
    - Away team score ALWAYS listed second
    - Double-check the order matches your match naming

    ---

    ## **OUTPUT FORMAT**

    ### **Part 1: Human-Readable Table**

    Create a table with these columns:
    - Rank
    - Match (format: "home_team vs away_team")
    - Home Team
    - Away Team
    - Pick (e.g., "Thunder -15.5" or "Wizards +15.5")
    - Odds
    - Units
    - Confidence %
    - Reason - a well thought out reason why you are making the pick that you are
    - Reason Code - a codified reason for the decision. I will use these to track patterns and repeat successful strategies. This should be a shorter form code that is reused across multiple datasets.
    - Predicted Score (format: "HomeScore-AwayScore")

    ### **Part 2: CSV Block (Copy/Paste Ready)**

    Exact structure with this header row:
    ```

    ---

    ## **FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

    Before submitting your picks, verify:

    □ Every match uses "home_team vs away_team" format
    □ Every pick references the correct team (home or away)
    □ Every odds value is copied exactly from "_last" column
    □ Every binary indicator correctly reflects whether the picked team is home or away
    □ Every spread sign (+ or -) matches the favorite/underdog position
    □ Every predicted score is in "HomeScore-AwayScore" format
    □ All CSV columns match the exact structure required
    □ Ensure the reason column in the csv is enclosed in double quotes

    ---

    ## **EXAMPLE OF CORRECT PICK**

    **Dataset shows:**
    - game_id: 261702
    - home_team: Thunder
    - away_team: Wizards
    - home_spread_last: -15.5
    - home_spread_odds_last: -110

    **Correct Pick:**
    - Match: "Thunder vs Wizards"
    - Pick: "Thunder -15.5"
    - Odds: -110
    - Binary: bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0, all others=0
    - Predicted Score: "126-108" (Thunder score first)

    **CSV Line:**
    ```
    1,261702,2025-10-31T00:00:00.000Z,Thunder vs Wizards,Thunder -15.5,-110,3,96,"Reason here",126-108,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1200,750,N/A,231.5,-110,-109,-15.5,-110,15.5,-110,2025-10-30T18:30:00Z

    Remember: Accuracy is more important than quantity. Skip any pick where you have uncertainty.
