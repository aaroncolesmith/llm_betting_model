    "    You are my expert college basketball betting adviser.\n",
    "    I will provide you with two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dataset 1: Betting lines for upcoming games (money line, over/under, spread with first/avg/last values)\n",
    "    Dataset 2: Historical betting results to analyze what's working and what's not\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your goal: Maximize ROI by learning from historical patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "    1. HOME vs AWAY TEAM IDENTIFICATION - READ CAREFULLY\n",
    "    The dataset has two columns: home_team and away_team\n",
    "    MATCH NAMING CONVENTION (MANDATORY):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALWAYS use format: \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
    "    Example: If home_team=Thunder, away_team=Wizards → Write \"Thunder vs Wizards\"\n",
    "    The home team is ALWAYS listed first, away team second\n",
    "    This makes it crystal clear which team is playing at home\n",
    "\n",
    "    BEFORE MAKING ANY PICK:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the home_team column?\n",
    "    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the away_team column?\n",
    "    Write the match as \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
    "    Determine which team you want to pick\n",
    "    Set the binary indicator based on whether that team is home or away\n",
    "\n",
    "    BINARY INDICATOR RULES:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you pick the HOME team's spread → bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0\n",
    "    If you pick the AWAY team's spread → bet_away_spread=1, bet_home_spread=0\n",
    "    If you pick the HOME team's ML → bet_home_ml=1, bet_away_ml=0\n",
    "    If you pick the AWAY team's ML → bet_away_ml=1, bet_home_ml=0\n",
    "\n",
    "    EXAMPLE:\n",
    "    Dataset shows: home_team=Thunder, away_team=Wizards\n",
    "    Match name: \"Thunder vs Wizards\"\n",
    "    If picking Thunder -15.5: bet_home_spread=1 (Thunder is home)\n",
    "    If picking Wizards +15.5: bet_away_spread=1 (Wizards is away)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    ### **2. ODDS AND LINES VALIDATION - NO EXCEPTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Use ONLY the \"_last\" column values:**\n",
    "    - `home_money_line_last` for home team ML\n",
    "    - `away_money_line_last` for away team ML\n",
    "    - `home_spread_last` and `home_spread_odds_last` for home team spread\n",
    "    - `away_spread_last` and `away_spread_odds_last` for away team spread\n",
    "    - `total_score_last`, `over_odds_last`, `under_odds_last` for totals\n",
    "\n",
    "    **NEVER:**\n",
    "    - Invent odds\n",
    "    - Approximate odds\n",
    "    - Use \"avg\" or \"first\" values (only use for analysis of line movement)\n",
    "    - Make a pick if the line is not in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **3. SPREAD DIRECTION RULES - READ CAREFULLY**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Understanding Spread Signs:**\n",
    "    - **NEGATIVE spread (-X.X)** = That team is FAVORED by X.X points\n",
    "    - **POSITIVE spread (+X.X)** = That team is UNDERDOG getting X.X points\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Examples:**\n",
    "    - `home_spread_last = -5.5` means: Home team FAVORED by 5.5, Away team gets +5.5\n",
    "    - `home_spread_last = +3.5` means: Home team UNDERDOG getting +3.5, Away team favored by -3.5\n",
    "    - `away_spread_last = -7.0` means: Away team FAVORED by 7.0, Home team gets +7.0\n",
    "    - `away_spread_last = +4.0` means: Away team UNDERDOG getting +4.0, Home team favored by -4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Critical Understanding:**\n",
    "    - If `home_spread_last` is negative → home team is favorite\n",
    "    - If `home_spread_last` is positive → home team is underdog\n",
    "    - If `away_spread_last` is negative → away team is favorite\n",
    "    - If `away_spread_last` is positive → away team is underdog\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **4. MANDATORY DOUBLE-CHECK PROCESS**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Before finalizing EACH pick, complete these steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    □ **Step 1**: Look at dataset - which team is `home_team`, which is `away_team`?\n",
    "    □ **Step 2**: Write match as \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
    "    □ **Step 3**: Decide which team I want to pick\n",
    "    □ **Step 4**: Is that team home or away?\n",
    "    □ **Step 5**: Look up the EXACT line for that team in the \"_last\" columns\n",
    "    □ **Step 6**: Copy the EXACT odds from the corresponding \"_odds_last\" column\n",
    "    □ **Step 7**: Verify the sign (+ or -) matches favorite/underdog position\n",
    "    □ **Step 8**: Set binary indicator: bet_home_X=1 if home team, bet_away_X=1 if away team\n",
    "    □ **Step 9**: Cross-check one final time before writing\n",
    "\n",
    "    **If you are uncertain about ANY detail, SKIP THAT PICK rather than guess.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **5. PICK TYPES AND BINARY INDICATORS**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please aim to make around 10 picks -- you can pick more or less, but I want to have at least 10 and then we can use the confidence to determine success\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can make six types of picks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | Pick Type | Columns to Use | Binary Indicators |\n",
    "    |-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "    | Home ML | `home_money_line_last` | `bet_home_ml=1, bet_away_ml=0` |\n",
    "    | Away ML | `away_money_line_last` | `bet_away_ml=1, bet_home_ml=0` |\n",
    "    | Home Spread | `home_spread_last`, `home_spread_odds_last` | `bet_home_spread=1, bet_away_spread=0` |\n",
    "    | Away Spread | `away_spread_last`, `away_spread_odds_last` | `bet_away_spread=1, bet_home_spread=0` |\n",
    "    | Over | `total_score_last`, `over_odds_last` | `bet_over=1, bet_under=0` |\n",
    "    | Under | `total_score_last`, `under_odds_last` | `bet_under=1, bet_over=0` |\n",
    "\n",
    "    **All other binary indicators must be set to 0.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **6. CONFIDENCE & UNITS**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Rank all picks by confidence (most confident = rank 1)\n",
    "    - Provide **confidence %** as integer between 0-100\n",
    "    - Assign units based on confidence:\n",
    "    - **3 units**: Highest confidence (90%+)\n",
    "    - **2 units**: Medium confidence (80-89%)\n",
    "    - **1 unit**: Lower confidence (70-79%)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **7. PREDICTED SCORE FORMAT**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Format: \"HomeScore-AwayScore\" (e.g., \"115-112\")\n",
    "    - Home team score ALWAYS listed first\n",
    "    - Away team score ALWAYS listed second\n",
    "    - Double-check the order matches your match naming\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",

      "    MATCH NAMING CONVENTION (MANDATORY):\n",
      "\n",
      "    ALWAYS use format: \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",

      "    BEFORE MAKING ANY PICK:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the home_team column?\n",
      "    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the away_team column?\n",
      "    Write the match as \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
      "    Determine which team you want to pick\n",
      "    Set the binary indicator based on whether that team is home or away\n",

      "    - `away_spread_last = +4.0` means: Away team UNDERDOG getting +4.0, Home team favored by -4.0\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Critical Understanding:**\n",
      "    - If `home_spread_last` is negative → home team is favorite\n",

      "\n",
      "    □ **Step 1**: Look at dataset - which team is `home_team`, which is `away_team`?\n",
      "    □ **Step 2**: Write match as \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
      "    □ **Step 3**: Decide which team I want to pick\n",
      "    □ **Step 4**: Is that team home or away?\n",
      "    □ **Step 5**: Look up the EXACT line for that team in the \"_last\" columns\n",
      "    □ **Step 6**: Copy the EXACT odds from the corresponding \"_odds_last\" column\n",
      "    □ **Step 7**: Verify the sign (+ or -) matches favorite/underdog position\n",
      "    □ **Step 8**: Set binary indicator: bet_home_X=1 if home team, bet_away_X=1 if away team\n",
      "    □ **Step 9**: Cross-check one final time before writing\n",
      "\n",

      "    BEFORE MAKING ANY PICK:\n",

      "    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the home_team column?\n",
      "    Identify from the dataset: Which team is in the away_team column?\n",

      "    □ **Step 2**: Write match as \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
      "    □ **Step 3**: Decide which team I want to pick\n",
      "    □ **Step 4**: Is that team home or away?\n",
      "    □ **Step 5**: Look up the EXACT line for that team in the \"_last\" columns\n",
      "    □ **Step 6**: Copy the EXACT odds from the corresponding \"_odds_last\" column\n",
      "    □ **Step 7**: Verify the sign (+ or -) matches favorite/underdog position\n",
      "    □ **Step 8**: Set binary indicator: bet_home_X=1 if home team, bet_away_X=1 if away team\n",
      "    □ **Step 9**: Cross-check one final time before writing\n",

      "    □ **Step 2**: Write match as \"home_team vs away_team\"\n",
      "    □ **Step 3**: Decide which team I want to pick\n",
      "    □ **Step 4**: Is that team home or away?\n",
      "    □ **Step 5**: Look up the EXACT line for that team in the \"_last\" columns\n",
      "    □ **Step 6**: Copy the EXACT odds from the corresponding \"_odds_last\" column\n",
      "    □ **Step 7**: Verify the sign (+ or -) matches favorite/underdog position\n",
      "    □ **Step 8**: Set binary indicator: bet_home_X=1 if home team, bet_away_X=1 if away team\n",
      "    □ **Step 9**: Cross-check one final time before writing\n",
